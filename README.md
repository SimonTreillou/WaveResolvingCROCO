# WaveResolvingCROCO

Some CROCO code and implementations for wave-resolving simulations.

### 01-spectrum_input_file
- Allow you to use a specific spectrum as input via a file text ("freq[i] S[i]" format). Check to have the adequate number of frequency via the provided Python code.

### 02-onlineparticletracking
- Test of the module ```FLOATS``` in a wave-resolving simulation.

### 03-frequencydependantangle
- Extend the wavemaker capacity to have frequency-dependant wave angles.
